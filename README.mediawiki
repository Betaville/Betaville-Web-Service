== Betaville Web Service ==

This is a deployable PHP service that allows for API calls over HTTP/HTTPS to a Betaville Server.
This project was started in the Summer of 2011 as a companion to some iOS work.  The iOS efforts
floundered, but the web service lived on and saw improvement over the next year.  The service
currently drives the web component for Betaville but work is underway on the desktop client's
networking component so that it can work with either this service or the traditional Java server.

=== Requirements ===
* MySQL 5 or newer
* PHP 5.2 or newer

==== Dependencies ====

A fairly standard LAMP setup with PHP/MySQL integration should not have any problems with deploying
this service.

=== Deployment ===

Clone this repository or download a zip and put it in a web-accessible directory on your server.

==== Configuration ====

Configuration is handled through the ''config.php'' file in the top level directory.
